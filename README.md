## 🚀 Why Join  
We’re a venture-backed pre-seed startup re-architecting how data moves—across devices, agents, and entire systems. The internet was designed for dial-up. We’re building for machines.

This is not a tweak. This is a full rethinking of the internet stack, from TCP to switches to cloud-edge orchestration. We're completely transforming networking, from the bottom up. If you want to build the pipes of the AGI era, and you thrive in deep, technical challenges at the edge of what’s possible... let’s talk.
