## 🧠 What You’ll Do  
- Build real-time, deterministic AI systems that guide how packets are processed, prioritized, and routed  
- Engineer across OSI layers 2–4 using custom socket logic and system-level tooling  
- Optimize AI inference across diverse hardware: data centers, financial trading, embedded systems, distributed and volatile networks  
- Design for degraded and contested environments with strict performance guarantees  
- Collaborate directly with the founding team on zero-to-one infrastructure and product roadmap  
- Deliver infrastructure that meets the performance, security, and compliance standards required for both commercial deployment and national use  

---

## ⚙️ What You Bring  
- 3+ years of systems-level engineering experience  
- Strong C++, Rust, and Python skills; background in architecture and low-level tooling  
- Experience with real-time inference, AI deployment, or ultra-low-latency pipelines  
- Familiarity with kernel bypass (e.g. DPDK), advanced networking, and OS-level programming  
- Fluency in observability and inference stack (e.g. ONNX, TensorRT)  
- Experience building AI agents or next-gen developer tooling for autonomous workflows  

---

## 🧩 Bonus  
- Socket-level optimization or heterogeneous compute expertise  
- Background in high-stakes environments: hedge funds, HPC, U.S. defense/intelligence, or national labs  
- Experience in telecom, network protocol design, or FPGA/SmartNIC programming  
- Deep understanding of modern encryption techniques and neural network deployment

## 🚀 Why Join  
We’re a venture-backed pre-seed startup re-architecting how data moves—across devices, agents, and entire systems. The internet was designed for dial-up. We’re building for AI.

This is not a tweak. It’s a full rethinking of the internet stack—from TCP and UDP to how switches and protocols function in mission-critical environments. We're deploying the first intelligent, ultra-low latency network stack optimized for real-time AI agents, trading systems, and contested networks.  

If you want to build the pipes of the AGI era, and you thrive in deep, technical challenges at the edge of what’s possible, let’s talk.
